      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He is
        the son of Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian, and Errol
        Musk, an engineer and pilot. Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a
        younger sister, Tosca.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musk was a gifted child and showed an early interest in engineering and
        science. He attended Queen's University in Canada, where he studied
        physics and economics. After graduating from Queen's, Musk moved to the
        United States to attend Stanford University, where he was accepted into
        the Ph.D. program in applied physics and material sciences. However,
        Musk dropped out of Stanford after two days to pursue his
        entrepreneurial dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musk's first venture was Zip2, a software company that provided business
        directories and maps to newspapers. Zip2 was acquired by Compaq
        Computers in 1999 for $307 million. Musk then founded X.com, an online
        financial services company that merged with Confinity in 2000 to form
        PayPal. PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, a private space exploration company.
        SpaceX has developed the Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon spacecraft,
        which have been used to launch satellites and cargo into orbit. SpaceX
        is also developing the Starship, a reusable rocket that could eventually
        be used to send humans to Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2003, Musk founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company. Tesla has
        developed the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y electric cars.
        Tesla is also developing the Semi, an electric semi-trailer truck, and
        the Roadster, an electric sports car.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a tunnel construction
        company that is developing a high-speed transportation system called the
        Loop. Musk is also the co-founder of Neuralink, a company that is
        developing brain-computer interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musk is a controversial figure, but he is also one of the most
        influential entrepreneurs of our time. He has been praised for his
        vision and his willingness to take risks. However, he has also been
        criticized for his management style and his sometimes erratic behavior.
